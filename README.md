Online Toll Processing System


    This project is done to save the time which we waste on Tollgate. You should prepay the Toll amount of particular toll through website and the list of Tolls between Source and Destination will be displayed in the payment page.In Real Time when the car reaches the toll it locates the number plate in captured image using Object Detection and Haar Cascade method which is done using Python.
    Using the OCR Technique,Number plate image is converted into Text by using
Tesseract Module.The Text contains the Vehicle Number is compared with the database for
Payment Verification.If yes then it also the vehicle to pass else it denies.All the backendprocess are done using Python and it uses less than a second for the total process.Some Constraints like dimensions of number plate is applicable to this project.
